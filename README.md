# Osteoarthritis-Detection

An orthopaedist is a medical doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders related to the skeletal system. Part of their job is to distinguish between a healthy person and a person with Osteoarthritis by looking at their knee X-ray images.

Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis, commonly known as wear-and-tear arthritis, is a condition in which the natural cushioning between joints -- cartilage -- wears away. When this happens, the bones of the joints rub more closely against one another with less of the shock-absorbing benefits of cartilage. The rubbing results in pain, swelling, stiffness, decreased ability to move, and sometimes the formation of bone spurs.

This file contains a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis is present or not in a given knee X-ray image using inceptionV3(GoogleNet) architecture.

The Dataset contains three folders:  

  1. Test (845 images) <br>
  2. Train (2350 images) <br>
  3. Valid (641 images) <br>

Each of these folders has two folders  

1.  Test <br>
   1.1 Normal <br>
   1.2 Osteoarthritis <br>
2.  Train <br>
   2.1 Normal <br>
   2.2 Osteoarthritis <br>
3.  Valid <br>
   3.1 Normal <br>
   3.2 Osteoarthritis <br>
